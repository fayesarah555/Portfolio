        <h2 id="history">History</h2>
        <p><strong>Power Rangers</strong> is an entertainment and merchandising franchise built around a live-action superhero television series, based on the Japanese tokusatsu franchise <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Sentai">Super Sentai</a></em>. Produced first by Saban Entertainment, second by BVS Entertainment, later by Saban Brands, and today by SCG Power Rangers LLC and its parent company, Hasbro, the Power Rangers television series takes much of its footage from the <em>Super Sentai</em> television series, produced by Toei Company.<sup><a href="#ref-1">[1]</a></sup> The first Power Rangers entry, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, debuted on August 28, 1993, and helped launch the Fox Kids programming block of the 1990s, during which it catapulted into popular culture along with a line of action figures and other toys by Bandai.<sup><a href="#ref-2">[2]</a></sup> By 2001, the media franchise had generated over $6 billion in toy&nbsp;sales.<sup><a href="ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>

        <p>Despite initial criticism that its action violence targeted child audiences, the franchise has been commercially successful. As of 2022, Power Rangers consists of 29 television seasons of 21 different themed series and three theatrical films released in 1995, 1997, and&nbsp;2017.</p>
        <p>In 2010, Haim Saban, creator of the series, regained ownership of the franchise. It was previously owned for eight years by The Walt Disney Company. In 2018, Hasbro was named the new master toy licensee. Shortly afterwards, Saban Brands and Hasbro announced that the latter would acquire the franchise and the rest of the former’s entertainment assets in a $522 million deal, with the first products from Hasbro becoming available in early&nbsp;2019.</p>

        <p>The low-tech way of remaking something&nbsp;foreign.</p>
        <h3 id="choosing-a-sentai">Choosing a Sentai</h3>
        <p>According to Chip Lynn, Saban (and later Hasbro) would peer over all entries of the <em>Super Sentai</em> series and pick one that looked “cool” or appealing to American children. He’d then hire staff to pen scripts as such during the pre-production process, but this became an issue for seasons that were still airing at the time as shooting for that particular Sentai season was still&nbsp;unfinished.</p>
        <p>Lynn stated that some Sentai seasons that were natively shot on film in a 4:3 aspect ratio, could not be adapted as modern times have moved on to digital footage instead through a 16:9 aspect ratio&nbsp;instead.</p>
        <h3 id="adapting-the-sentai">Adapting the Sentai</h3>
        <p>As for elements that do or not get carried over into Power Rangers, higher-ups at Saban Entertainment (and later Hasbro) pick and choose what appeals to an American audience from a marketing perspective, such as certain monster&nbsp;suits.</p>
        <p>There are mandates that require certain seasons to use at least a certain amount of Sentai footage. Greg Aronowitz has stated the difficulty of simultaneously writing original stories and meticulously choosing what Sentai footage to use for certain scenes while meeting footage mandates. Lynn stated that after a while, Saban allowed the entire writing team full creative control over the story while serving only as the “final&nbsp;say.”</p>
